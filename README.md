# [CharacterReroll](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-league-blaze/p/avg_duck/CharacterReroll/)

Reworks the random character select! The random button now rolls a character and skin for you on the character select screen, and allows you to reroll your choice.

The icon for the random button has also been changed to show the different functionality!
